verse1a
I'm a doll and nothing more
deny all my rights
adore me and I'll want to be in your bed tonight

verse1b
it takes so much to remain this high
I keep on taking, still I need you to try
cause when you're open I can feed off attention
your eyes trained on mine (on mine)

chorus1a
in the sunroom you looked empty
I’m just a ditch that drains all of your energy
sensing distance, digging deeper
the more you're trapped the more I feel I need you, now

chorus1b
you don’t want it, you don’t need it
you couldn’t try, you wouldn’t lie 
just to keep me off your back
I tried so hard but it was leaving you flat, throwing good after bad

verse2a
I tried too much and I got this way
so now you’re leaving when I want you to stay
somehow we're naked, now you know what I need
the only lung that breathes

verse2b
when you drove to the hill that night
you call me crying and flashing your lights
and I could see you cause I'd pulled back the curtain
we only work at our worst (its worse)

chorus2a
in the sunroom you looked empty
I’m just a ditch that drains all of your energy
sensing distance, digging deeper
the more you're trapped the more I feel I need you, now
I could feel it getting better
what if I try to do all the things you told me would help you

chorus2b
am I failing, is it a problem
if I don’t want to let anything go
so I can know that I gave it all I have
or am I wasting your time, throwing good after bad

chorus3a
sensing distance, digging deeper
the more you're trapped the more I feel I need you, now
while I got your understanding
I always needed more than what I told you I’d need
I could feel it getting better
what if I try to do all the things you told me would help you

chorus3b
can I own it, did I love you
can I trust a single thing that I felt
did I just lie to myself
my only anchor, the concern that you feigned and the filth in our brains

outro
when I was a kid I was so determined I’d tell them what I want
I lost my will but now I’m clawing it back, throwing good after bad
