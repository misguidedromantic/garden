        I'm building a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) where I will combine my loves of programming,
        data visualisation, photography, design, personal knowledge management, and of course songwriting and music production, 
        unconstanied by the formatting of social media platforms.

        I want to share more of my creative thinking and output in progress. While I'm typically reluctant to do this for my songs, 
        I don't feel the same way about other aspects, and I've realised I am happy to share and visualise data about songs in the making, 
        alongside those that I have completed.
    </p>

        
    <p>
        Hope you enjoy watching this garden (website) grow over time. It's rough right now but I have grand plans.
